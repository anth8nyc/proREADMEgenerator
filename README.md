## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command with an integrated terminal:

    npm i
## Usage
Run node index on the index.js file to begin the prompts for the READme generation. Note: the file created will use the project title to prepend the new file name in case you are generating multiple READmes. Do not forget to remove this preprend after moving your READme to its respective repo folder location-- especially if you are using GitHub, as GitHub searches for a file with the simple name of "README.md".
