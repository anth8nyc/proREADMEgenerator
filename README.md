If no licenses are selected, the license section is excluded, as is the table of contents link for it. The last prompt asks the user if they plan on including image files either at the top or within the Usage are of the README as a demo. Note: the file created will use the project title to prepend the new file name in case you are generating multiple READmes. Do not forget to remove this preprend after moving your READme to its respective repo folder location-- especially if you are using GitHub, as GitHub searches for a file with the simple name of "README.md".
